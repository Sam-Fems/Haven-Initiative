      About Haven Initiative

      Where your candle meets the burning flame.

      Haven Initiative is a transformative mentorship movement created to help young people discover who they are, build what they can become, and step confidently into purpose. We exist because too many teenagers carry gifts that never meet the right environment, mentorship, or opportunity. At Haven, we provide that environment: a safe, structured, faith-anchored space where talent is discovered, character is formed, and action is taken.

      Our Why

      We believe every young person is a light — a candle — with potential to illuminate homes, schools, and communities. But light needs a flame. Haven is the match, the place, and the people who bring steady heat: practical training, spiritual encouragement, academic support, and real-world exposure. We prepare young people not just to succeed, but to lead with humility, courage, and clarity.

      Founders & Leadership

      Boluwatife — Co-founder and program visionary — started Haven from a place of personal mentorship experience and a conviction that young people deserve intentional, sustained investment. Her heart for young people, emphasis on identity and purpose, and skills in program design are the backbone of Haven’s approach.

      Isabella — Co-founder (age 16) — brings youthful insight, peer perspective, and creative energy to the Initiative. As a young co-founder, Isabella ensures our programs remain relevant, relatable, and responsive to the needs of today’s teens. Together, Boluwatife and Isabella lead Haven with a combination of wise strategy and lived peer experience.

      We are also grateful to collaborate with Seedtime Foundation, a partner that helps broaden our reach and deepen our resources. By God’s grace, as the Initiative grows we plan to provide financial and legal assistance to mentees in need — practical support that removes barriers and unlocks more possibilities.

      Mission & Vision

      Mission: To mentor, equip, and mobilize teenagers to grow in character, competence, and calling — academically, creatively, spiritually, and socially.
      Vision: A generation of confident, skilled, and purpose-driven young leaders who influence their communities with integrity and excellence.

      What We Do — Three Pillars of Impact

      Haven operates across three integrated pillars: Discovery, Development, Deployment.

      Discovery: Guided assessments, one-on-one conversations, talent labs, and reflective sessions help mentees understand their gifts, passions, personality, and direction. We use reading, movies, psychology introductions, and practical tasks to reveal strengths and interests.

      Development: Once gifts are identified, we train. This involves targeted academic support, soft-skills workshops (communication, public speaking, leadership), creative mentorship (art, writing, music), STEM and vocational exposure, and faith and character formation. Classes are structured, interactive, and include icebreakers, short assessments, and accountability routines.

      Deployment: Learning must be lived. Mentees create and present projects, run community volunteer activities in partnership with Seedtime Foundation, and mentor younger peers. Each cohort ends with a showcase where mentees present a project — creative, academic, entrepreneurial, or service-based — demonstrating growth and maturity.


      Program Structure & Features

      Haven runs a year-long structured pathway made up of four phases, each with specific goals, activities, and assessments. Every mentee completes seven core courses (Psychology, Language, Potentials, Soft Skills, Academic, STEM, Relationship) and participates in team-based mentorship pods. Our approach uses peer accountability, paired partners, and themed teams (Ezers, Bethels, Skylers, Zions, Lights, Sacred, Rehoboths) that provide identity, responsibility, and belonging.

      Key program features:

      Weekly sessions (online with occasional physical meetups)

      Book clubs and movie reflections (curated lists for each phase)

      Regular assessments and a final project showcase

      Mandatory volunteer service to build civic responsibility

      Extra academic clinics for mentees preparing for external exams

      Pathways for graduates to become mentors and leaders in the Initiative


      Values That Guide Us

      Faith: Everything we do is underpinned by spiritual formation and reliance on God.

      Integrity: We act with honesty, accountability, and excellence.

      Service: We measure success by our ability to serve others.

      Community: Growth happens best in warm, disciplined relationships.

      Creativity & Innovation: We equip young people to think imaginatively and solve problems.


      Who We Serve

      We welcome teenagers aged roughly 8–16 (and recent high-school graduates in leadership or mentoring tracks) from diverse backgrounds. We intentionally recruit mentees who demonstrate curiosity, teachability, and a desire to serve. Selection combines application screening, short interviews, and dedication indicators — we choose those ready to commit to the process.

      Outcomes & Impact

      Haven measures success in changed lives: improved academic confidence, newly discovered talents, stronger emotional health, leadership in community projects, and increased spiritual maturity. Our mentees graduate with a portfolio — books they’ve reviewed, projects they’ve completed, and habits that prepare them for school, work, and service.

      Looking Ahead

      We plan to expand our geographic reach, develop scholarship and micro-grant opportunities, and establish a physical Haven Center — a safe, resource-rich hub for workshops, study, and creative production. Our long-term dream is to raise thousands of young leaders who reproduce the same gift of mentorship in their communities.
